## Description
This JavaScript quiz is a web-based application that allows users to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals. Users can click on the start button to begin the quiz, and once the quiz begins, a timer will start counting down from a certain number of seconds. The quiz consists of a series of multiple-choice questions, with four options for each question. Once the user selects an answer, the quiz will automatically move on to the next question.

If the user answers a question incorrectly, time will be subtracted from the clock. When all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0, the game is over. At the end of the game, the user can save their initials and score to a leaderboard that displays the highest scores.

## Installation
This application can be accessed through any modern web browser.

## Usage
To use this application, simply open the index.html file in your web browser and click on the start button to begin the quiz. Answer the questions as they appear on the screen and click on the submit button when you are done. You will be prompted to enter your initials, and then your score will be displayed on the leaderboard.
